- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cooper-Adams
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development and design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, Ruby on Rails, and more complex JavaScript/HTML/CSS techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will allow me to learn new things. Front-end related projects are the best! But I also feel it is beneficial to have skills in many areas, and I will not shy away from any programming language.
